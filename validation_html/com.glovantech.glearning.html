</br>Website and product improvement. We may use your personal information to perform business analyses or for other purposes to improve the quality of our business, our sites and Glovantech products or services (including new products or services), or to make our sites easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing our sites to your particular preference or interests.

</br></br>
Our use of cookies and web beacons. Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your hard disk or to your device's memory when you visit one of Glovantech's sites. Cookies are useful because they help arrange the content and layout of our sites and allow us to recognize those computers or other devices that have been to our sites before. Cookies do many different jobs, such as allowing our sites to remember your preference settings and helping us to enhance the usability and performance of our sites and your experience using them.
</br>Our sites also may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow us to count the number of users who have visited specific pages. We may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
</br></br>
Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers or device applications may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the sites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how it incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, sites should do when they receive such signals.
</br>Glovantech currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, Glovantech will reassess how to respond to these signals.
</br></br>

Disclosure of your personal information. Except as described below, personal information that we collect about you through our sites or that you provide to us when you contact us will not be shared outside of Glovantech without your permission.
</br></br>
Disclosure to service providers. Glovantech contracts with other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as hosting sites, sending out information, conducting surveys, processing transactions, analysing our sites and performing business and other analyses to improve the quality of our business, our sites and Glovantech products or services. We provide these companies with only those elements of your personal information they need to deliver those services effectively. These companies and their employees are prohibited from using personal information they receive from Glovantech for any other purpose.
</br></br>
Disclosure in connection with transactions. In connection with certain transactions, we may disclose some or all of your personal information to financial institutions, government entities and shipping companies or postal services involved in fulfilment of the transaction.
</br></br>
Disclosures in connection with acquisitions or divestitures. Circumstances may arise where for strategic or other business reasons Glovantech decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of personal information sellers. We may disclose information we maintain about you to the extent reasonably necessary to proceed with the negotiation or completion of a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of Glovantech's assets. It is Glovantech's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
</br></br>
Disclosure for other reasons. We may disclose personal information if required or authorized to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal requirements or with legal process served on us, to protect and defend our rights or property or, in urgent circumstances, to protect the personal safety of any individual.
</br></br>
Security. Glovantech is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For sites to which you log in, it is your responsibility to ensure the security of your password and not to reveal this information to others.

By using our sites or contacting us and giving your information to us, you consent to the transfer of the data outside of your country.
</br></br>
Provider of processing services and processing in countries outside the European Economic Area. In some cases, we arrange for external service providers to process your data (e.g. troubleshooting, creation of mailings). This makes it necessary for us to transmit your personal data to our external service providers for a specified purpose (confined to the purpose in question). We have selected our service providers carefully and commissioned them in writing. They are bound by our instructions and we have obtained information about their technical and organisational measures for the secure processing of personal data. We also require that our service providers comply with the applicable data protection regulations. We have started processing contracts with our external service providers in accordance with Article 28(3.) GDPR, EU standard contractual clauses in accordance with Article 28(7.) GDPR or the transmission is based on a decision of the EU Commission in accordance with Article 45 GDPR. We also work with paymentservice providers that facilitate payment processing. If you have agreed to receive news and personalized offers and to be contacted by us for studies, product or service improvement and surveys, then we work with marketing agencies and service providers. Please do not hesitate to contact us at info@glovantech.com if you would like to know more about the service providers we engage. We do not sell personal data to third parties. However, we do reserve the right to disclose information about you if we are legally obliged to or if we are required to surrender it by administrative or law enforcement bodies (e.g. police or public prosecutors).
</br></br>
Your rights. You have the right to request information from us at any time about your personal data we have stored and the origin, recipients or categories of recipients to whom these data are forwarded or otherwise disclosed, the purpose of the storage and processing, the planned storage period, our automated decision-making procedure, the right to data portability, the existence of a right to rectification, erasure, restriction of or objection to processing, and any existing right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. You also have the right to rectification of incorrect data and, in cases where the legal requirements are met, to blocking and erasure, as well as to restrict the processing of data. You may also send requests for information, withdrawals of consent, objections and other concerns regarding data processing by email to info@glovantech.com or to the address stated in the Contact Us.</br></br>
Links to other sites. Our sites may contain links to other sites. We may also link to third-party providers that host, maintain and operate on-line training or other products or services. Although we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites.
</br></br>
Data security. We have taken appropriate technical and organisational measures to guarantee data security, in particular to protect your personal data against access by third parties, as well as accidental or intentional modification, loss or destruction. Such measures are reviewed periodically and adapted in line with the industry practices.
</br></br>
Storage period. In principle, we process and store your data for the duration of our contractual relationship. In addition, we are subject to various retention and documentation requirements. The required periods, e.g. from tax law, can be up to 10 years. Moreover, special statutory provisions can make a longer retention period necessary, e.g. evidence in the context of statutory periods of limitation. If data are no longer required for compliance with contractual or statutory requirements, they are regularly deleted, unless their limited further processing is necessary for the purposes listed above.</br></br>
