IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL, USE, REGISTER TO OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE SERVICES. <br /><br />BIG BAJA reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at reasonable times, so please review it frequently. Your continued use of Services will signify your acceptance of the changes to this Privacy Policy.  1. Non-personal data  For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “non-personal data” means information that does not directly identify you. Additionally, non-personal data means “aggregate” and “de-personalized” information, which is data BIG BAJA collects about the use of BIG BAJA Services, from which any personally identifiable data has been removed.  BIG BAJA may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not directly enable BIG BAJA to identify you. <br /><br />The types of non-personal data BIG BAJA may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) device properties, including, but not limited to IP address, Media Access Control (“MAC”) address and unique device identifier or other persistent or non-persistent device identifier ("Device ID"); (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as zip code, area code and coarse location; (v) game progress, time used playing, score and achievements; (vi) other non-personal data as reasonably required by BIG BAJA to enhance the Services and other BIG BAJA products and services.  BIG BAJA may use Flurry analytics tool in order to develop and analyze use of the Services. If you wish to opt-out from Flurry analytics, please follow this link: http://www.flurry.com/resources/privacy.html.  BIG BAJA may use and disclose to BIG BAJA’s partners and contractors the collected non-personal data for purposes of analyzing usage of the Services, advertisement serving, managing and providing the Services and to further develop the Services and other BIG BAJA services and products.  You recognize and agree that the analytics companies, such as Facebook and Flurry, utilized by BIG BAJA.  BIG BAJA may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to your activities. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.  <br /><br />BIG BAJA may supplement your personal and non-personal data with data received from third parties in connection with demographic, advertisement, market and other analytics surveys or services.  2. Ad Serving Technology  BIG BAJA reserves the right to use and disclose the collected non-personal data for purposes of advertisement by BIG BAJA or BIG BAJA’s partners and contractors. BIG BAJA may employ third party ad serving technologies that use certain methods to collect information as a result of ad serving through Services. BIG BAJA or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use demographic and location information as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Service. BIG BAJA or third parties may collect and use data for this purpose including, but not limited to IP address (including but not limited to for purposes of determining your coarse location), Device ID, MAC, software, applications, hardware, browser information, internet and on-line usage information and in-game information. The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.  You recognize and agree that the advertising companies who deliver ads for BIG BAJA may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. <br /><br />These ad serving technologies are integrated into Services; if you do not want to be subject to this technology, do not use or access Services. Although BIG BAJA takes commercially reasonable steps to instruct such advertising companies to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, BIG BAJA does not have access to or control of third party technologies.  BIG BAJA may display to you behaviorally targeted advertising. If you wish to "opt out" of certain targeted advertising, please visit http://www.youradchoices.com and/or www.networkadvertising.org. Please note that the links above may not reach all BIG BAJA’s advertising partners and certain behaviorally targeted advertising may still be displayed to you. If you want to be certain that no behaviorally targeted advertisements are not displayed to you, please do not use or access the Services. Additionally please note that if you “opt out” it does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising. It just means that the advertising you see displayed will not be customized to you and your interests and may be less relevant to you.  3. Location Data  To the extent BIG BAJA makes location enabled Services available and you use such Services, BIG BAJA may collect and process your location data to provide location related Services and advertisements. For example, some add-ons or offers may be available at dedicated locations. <br /><br />BIG BAJA may use various technologies to determine location, such as GPS, Wi-Fi or other network-based data such as IP address. Your GPS geo-location is not accessed without your consent. Notwithstanding BIG BAJA’s partners who are providing location related parts of the Service, BIG BAJA will not share your GPS geo-location with third parties without your consent. To the extent BIG BAJA makes available GPS geo-location to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy, it will be provided anonymously. Please note that BIG BAJA may share your anonymous coarse location with its partners.  4. Personal Data  For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal data” means personally identifiable information that specifically identifies you as an individual.  Likely situations when you make personal data available to BIG BAJA include, but are not limited to: (i) registration for Services, contests and special events; (ii) accessing Services using a third party ID, such as social networking sites or gaming services; (iii) subscribing to newsletters; (iv) purchasing a product or services through BIG BAJA’s online stores; (v) using “tell a friend,” "email this page," or other similar features; (vi) requesting technical support; and (vii) otherwise through use of BIG BAJA Services where personal data is required for use and/or participation.  The types of personal data may vary depending on the type of activity you are engaged in. The personal data BIG BAJA may collect, process and use may include, but are not limited to your name, screen/nick name, BIG BAJA Services’ or third party service ID, e-mail address, phone number, photo or other image, birth date, sex, address, friend connections, avatar image, credit card information, shipping information; and location (only if directly identifiable to you, otherwise BIG BAJA treats location as non-personal data).  If you choose to use BIG BAJA’s "tell a friend" or a similar service about BIG BAJA Services or order a gift certificate for your friend, BIG BAJA may store your friend's name and contact details that you provide to BIG BAJA.  BIG BAJA may use personal and non-personal data, both individually and combined together, for purposes of analyzing usage of the Services, providing customer and technical support, managing and providing Services (including managing advertisement serving), customizing BIG BAJA’s communications and to further develop the Services and other BIG BAJA services and products. BIG BAJA may combine non-personal data with personal data.  BIG BAJA may use your personal data to send messages to you with informative and/or commercial content about BIG BAJA’s services or third party products and services BIG BAJA thinks may be of interest to you, such as new features and services, special offers and updated information.  Please note that certain features of the Services may be able to connect to your social networking sites to obtain additional information about you. In such cases, BIG BAJA may be able to collect certain information from your social networking profile when your social networking site permits it, and when you consent to allow your social networking site to make that information available to BIG BAJA. This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, profile picture, gender, user ID, email address, your country, your language, your time zone, the organizations and links on your profile page, the names and profile pictures of your social networking site “friends” and other information you have included in your social networking site profile. BIG BAJA may associate and/or combine as well as use information collected by BIG BAJA and/or obtained through such social networking sites in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  <br /><br />5. Disclosure and Transfer of Personal Data  Personal data may be disclosed in accordance with applicable legislation and this Privacy Policy. Additionally, BIG BAJA may disclose personal data to its parent companies and its subsidiaries in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  BIG BAJA may hire agents and contractors to collect and process personal data on BIG BAJA’s behalf and in such cases such agents and contractors will be instructed to comply with our Privacy Policy and to use personal data only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by BIG BAJA. These agents and contractors may not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes. BIG BAJA may use third party service providers such as credit card processors, e-mail service providers, shipping agents, data analyzers and business intelligence providers. BIG BAJA has the right to share your personal data as necessary for the aforementioned third parties to provide their services for BIG BAJA. BIG BAJA is not liable for the acts and omissions of these third parties, except as provided by mandatory law.  BIG BAJA may disclose your personal data to third parties as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or BIG BAJA to legal liability. BIG BAJA may also disclose your personal data to third parties when BIG BAJA has a reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with BIG BAJA’s rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or BIG BAJA believes that such disclosure is necessary to protect BIG BAJA’s rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on BIG BAJA. To the extent permitted by applicable law, BIG BAJA will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such disclosure through BIG BAJA’s website or in another reasonable manner.<br /><br />  6. Data Retention and Correctness  BIG BAJA retains the data collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Thereafter if the collected data is no longer needed for purposes specified in this Privacy Policy, BIG BAJA deletes all aforementioned data in its possession within a reasonable timeframe. BIG BAJA does not verify the correctness of personal data.  Irrespective of the above, BIG BAJA may still retain some of the data to the extent such retention is necessary to resolve disputes, enforce BIG BAJA user agreements, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of Services.  <br /><br />7. Cookies, beacons and tracking  The Services may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags, locally shared objects, clear GIFs and web beacons. BIG BAJA treats information collected by cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.  Cookies: A “cookie” is a small bit of record-keeping information that websites often store on a user's computer. BIG BAJA’s cookies do not include personal data and are typically used to quickly identify your device and to “remember” you. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your device; however, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use the Services.  Flash cookies &amp; HTML5: BIG BAJA may also use Flash cookies (locally shared objects) and HTML5 storage (locally stored objects). Locally shared objects are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember your settings to personalize the look and feel of the Services. Locally shared objects only collect data in the aggregate. You may prevent locally shared objects from being placed by disabling locally stored objects in your browser or visit www.adobe.com. Locally stored objects, such as HTML5 Web Storage, are used for similar purposes as cookies but typically may contain a greater amount and different types of data than browser cookies.  Web Beacons and pixel tags: A “web beacon” or a “pixel tag” is an electronic image that allows BIG BAJA to count users who have visited certain pages or viewed certain advertisements. Web beacons, like cookies, do not include personal data. E-mails and other electronic communications BIG BAJA sends to you may contain pixel tags that enable BIG BAJA to track your usage of the communication, including whether the communication was opened and/or what links were followed, if any.  8. Third Party Terms and Conditions  Please note that your access to and use of the Services may be subject to certain third party terms and conditions and privacy policies, including but not limited to application stores, map data providers, mobile software platforms, on-line gaming platforms, social networking services and payment providers. You recognize and agree that BIG BAJA is not liable for any such third party terms and conditions and their use of your personal data.  BIG BAJA may in its discretion make available links through advertisements or otherwise enable you to access third party products or services. Please note that, while using such products or services, you are using products or services developed and administered by people or companies not affiliated with or controlled by BIG BAJA. BIG BAJA is not responsible for the actions of those people or companies, the content of their products or services, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer. The fact that BIG BAJA is linking to those products or services does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those people or companies.  BIG BAJA may from time to time make available BIG BAJA’s partners’ services, such as sweepstakes or polls and such services may require you to disclose personal data in order to register for and access such services. Such services will reasonably identify the partners at the point of where you are required to disclose personal data. If you at that point choose to disclose your personal data, such personal data may be transferred directly or via BIG BAJA to such third parties and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such third parties. BIG BAJA is not responsible for the privacy practices and policies of such third parties and, therefore, you should review the privacy practices and policies of such third parties prior disclosing any personal data in relation to such services.  Please note that certain Services that BIG BAJA may offer, such as multiplayer gaming, social networking and gaming console services, may use third party services to provide authentication for the Services with a gaming console ID, social networking ID or gaming network account. When you register to join or use the Services from a third-party gaming or social networking system, certain personally identifiable user and/or membership data may be transferred automatically to and from BIG BAJA and you hereby consent to the processing, using, combining, disclosing and retaining of such data in accordance with this Privacy Policy by BIG BAJA.  9. Safeguards  BIG BAJA follows generally accepted industry standards and maintains reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information in BIG BAJA’s possession. Only those persons with a need to process your personal data in connection with the fulfillment of their tasks in accordance with the purposes of this Privacy Policy and for the purposes of performing technical maintenance, have access to your personal data in BIG BAJA’s possession. Personal data collected by BIG BAJA is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public.
