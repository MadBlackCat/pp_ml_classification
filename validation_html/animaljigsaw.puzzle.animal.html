<p>Our advertising partners may combine this information with information which they have collected about you when you use their services (or the websites or services of third parties) in order to serve you more relevant ads in our games or to improve the accuracy of their targeting and measurement systems.</p>

We recommend that you review our advertising partners’ privacy policies for more information. A list of our advertising partners and their Privacy Policies can be found here.

<p>Opting-out of interest-based advertising<br />
You can choose to prevent your device&#8217;s ad identifier being used for interest-based advertising by updating the settings on your device. For more information, see How to adjust your preferences for interest based advertising below.</p>
<p>Please note that if you opt out of interest based advertising, you will still be able to play our games and you may still see advertising in our games but those ads will not be targeted using information that we hold about you. However, they may still be delivered based on contextual criteria such as the game that ad is to be displayed in, or the region in which your device is located.</p>
<p>Ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies<br />
To provide our games, Websites and interest-based advertising, we use ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies. This section describes our use of these technologies and how you can manage your preferences.</p>
<p>Ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies are used by us to provide our Services to you and in order to collect data from your device. These technologies allow us and our third party advertising partners to:</p>
<p>recognise you and your device;<br />
provide interest-based advertising to you;<br />
allow our Services to interact with a third party social network or platform (where you have chosen to allow such interaction);<br />
allow us to understand how you interact with our websites (for example, where we use cookies such as the Google Analytics cookie on our Websites);<br />
allow our payment processors to process your payment instructions; and<br />
enable us and third parties to provide you with more customized services, for example to provide our Services in the correct language.<br />
How do ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies work?<br />
Ad identifiers are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple&#8217;s ID for advertising (the ‘IDFA’), which are uniquely associated with your device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. These technologies allow companies (including marketers and advertisers) to recognise your device when you use websites and applications.</p>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are stored by your browser on your desktop computer or mobile device. You can withdraw your consent to cookies by updating the settings within your browser.</p>
<p>How to adjust your preferences for interest-based advertising<br />
You can choose to prevent your device&#8217;s ad identifier being used for interest-based advertising, or you can reset your device&#8217;s ad identifier, by changing the settings of your device. Settings vary from device to device but you will usually find the ad identifier settings under &#8220;privacy&#8221; or &#8220;ads&#8221; in your device&#8217;s settings.</p>
<p>If you live in the USA, Europe or Canada, you can also opt-out from the collection of your information by some or all of our advertising partners who participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ (for US users), http://www.youronlinechoices.com/ (for European users) or http://youradchoices.ca/choices (for Canadian users). You can also click on the AdChoices logo within an advertisement (where available).</p>
<p>If you choose to adjust your preferences in order to prevent these technologies, you may find that you cannot enjoy the full use of our Services.</p>
<p>Please note that adjusting your preferences as described in this section does not mean you will no longer receive adverts, it only means the adverts you do see will be less relevant to your interests. We will also still use your device’s ad identifier to serve you with ads; for example, we may use this for frequency capping (in other words, to control the maximum number of times you see the same ad from us).</p>
<p>The collection and/or processing in connection with these purposes will performed as permitted under applicable laws and rules.<br />
How the Information about our Users of Kids Games/Apps is being collected?
