<h2> Introductory</h2>
<p>The following agreement (this "Agreement" or the "Terms of Service") describes the terms of access to DiveNav, Inc. ("DiveNav") 's services. By using DiveNav services you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not so agree, you should decline this agreement, in which case you are prohibited from accessing or using DiveNav 's services. DiveNav may amend this Agreement at any time in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>1.1 Basic description of the services: DiveNav offers several services: eDiving, DiveComputerTraining, iDive Computer and divePAL. DiveNav is an online service, including client software and websites.</p>
<p>eDiving, DiveComputerTraining, iDive Computer and divePAL services are online services offered by DiveNav, including the software provided to you by DiveNav (collectively, the "DiveNav Software") and the online environments that support the service, including without limitation: the server computation, software access, maps, 3D models, images, graphics, videos, algorithms, simulations, user interfaces, decompression algorithms, oxygen toxicity algorithm, dive computer simulations, messaging and protocols that simulate the environments (the "Servers"), the software that are provided by DiveNav and installed on the local computer or other devices you use to access the Servers and thereby view or otherwise access the Servers (the "Clients"), application program interfaces provided by DiveNav to you for use with the Services (the "APIs"), and access to the websites and services available from DiveNav's domains and subdomains (the "Websites"). The Servers, Clients, APIs, Websites and any other DiveNav Software collectively constitute the "Service" as used in this Agreement.</p>
<p>1.3 The Service is subject to scheduled and unscheduled service interruptions. All aspects of the Service are subject to change or elimination at DiveNav's sole discretion.</p>
<p>3.1 You have a nonexclusive, limited, revocable license to use the Service while you are in compliance with the terms of service.</p>
<p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, DiveNav grants to you a non-exclusive, limited, fully revocable license to use the DiveNav Software and the rest of the Service during the time you are in full compliance with the Terms of Service. Nothing in this Agreement, or on DiveNav's websites, shall be construed as granting you any other rights or privileges of any kind with respect to the Service or to any Content. You acknowledge that your participation in the Service does not make you a DiveNav employee and that you do not expect to be, and will not be, compensated by DiveNav for such activities.</p>
<p>The Service is controlled and operated by DiveNav from its offices within the State of California, United States of America. DiveNav makes no representation that any aspect of the Service is appropriate or available for use in jurisdictions outside of the United States. Those who choose to access the Service from other locations are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. The DiveNav Software is subject to all applicable export restrictions. You must comply with all export and import laws and restrictions and regulations of any United States or foreign agency or authority relating to the DiveNav Software and its use.</p>
<p>This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and DiveNav with respect to the subject matter hereof. The section headings used herein, including descriptive summary sentences at the start of each section, are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then in such jurisdiction that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>
<h2> How We Collect and Use Your Information</h2>
<p>Welcome to DiveNav.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that: (i) by using the Service you may have access to graphics, maps, sound effects, music, videos, audio, computer programs, animation, images, text, simulations and other creative output (collectively, "Content"), and (ii) Content may be provided under license by independent content providers, including contributions from other users of the Service (all such independent content providers, "Content Providers").</p>
<p>2.1 You must establish an account to use the Service using true and accurate registration information.</p>
<p>At the time your Account is opened, you must select a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and are responsible for any harm resulting from your disclosure, or authorizing the disclosure of, your password or from use by any person of your password to gain access to your Account or Account Name. At no time should you respond to an online request for a password other than in connection with the log-on process to the Service. Your disclosure of your password to any other person is entirely at your own risk.</p>
<p>DiveNav does not provide Internet access, and you are responsible for all fees associated with your Internet connection.</p>
<p>4.1 You agree to abide by certain rules of conduct prohibiting illegal and other practices that DiveNav deems harmful.</p>
<p>4.2 You agree to use the Service as provided, without unauthorized software or other means of access or use. You will not make unauthorized works from or conduct unauthorized distribution of the DiveNav Software.</p>
<p>DiveNav has designed the Service to be experienced only as offered by DiveNav at the Websites or partner websites. DiveNav is not responsible for any aspect of the Service that is accessed or experienced using software or other means that are not provided by DiveNav. You agree not to create or provide any server emulators or other software or other means that provide access to or use of the Servers without the express written authorization of DiveNav. DiveNav is not obligated to allow access to the Servers by any software that is not provided by DiveNav, and you agree to cease using, creating, distributing or providing any such software at the request of DiveNav. You are prohibited from taking any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on DiveNav's infrastructure.</p>
<p>You may not charge any third party for using the DiveNav Software to access and/or use the Service, and you may not modify, adapt, reverse engineer (except as otherwise permitted by applicable law), decompile or attempt to discover the source code of the DiveNav Software, or create any derivative works of the DiveNav Software or the Service, or otherwise use the DiveNav Software except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

<p>5.1 You release DiveNav from your claims relating to your use of the Service. DiveNav has the right but not the obligation to resolve disputes between users of the Service. Scuba diving, like many other active sports, has inherent risks which might lead to injury or, in extreme cases, even to death. This Service, developed by DiveNav, while attempting to accurately simulate dive profiles, the related physics and physiology and how dive computers represent them, should not be used as the sole source of reference nor should replace the real life training provided by accredited instructors and diving professionals. Additionally, the decompression algorithm used in the Program might be significantly different from the decompression algorithm used in real dive computers. In consideration of being allowed to use the program, You agree to engage in real diving activities that are consistent with my training and experience. You further agree that neither DiveNav, nor its affiliates, nor any of its employees, officers, agents, contractors or assigns (the ÒReleased PartiesÓ) may be liable or responsible in any way for any death, injury or other damages caused to you, your family, heirs, estate or assigns that may occur as a result of you using the program. You further release, exempt and hold harmless said released parties from any claim or lawsuit by you, your family, estate, heirs or assigns arising from your use of the Service.</p>
<p>When using the Service, you may accumulate Content, objects, items, scripts, equipment, or other value or status indicators that reside as data on DiveNav's servers. THESE DATA, AND ANY OTHER DATA, ACCOUNT HISTORY AND ACCOUNT NAMES RESIDING ON DIVENAV'S SERVERS, MAY BE DELETED, ALTERED, MOVED OR TRANSFERRED AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON IN DIVENAV'S SOLE DISCRETION.</p>
<p>5.3 DiveNav provides the Service on an "as is" basis, without express or implied warranties.</p>
<p>DIVENAV PROVIDES THE SERVICE, THE DIVENAV SOFTWARE, YOUR ACCOUNT AND ALL OTHER SERVICES STRICTLY ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, PROVIDED AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WRITTEN OR ORAL, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
<p>5.4 DiveNav's liability to you is expressly limited, to the extent allowable under applicable law.</p>
<p>5.5 You will indemnify DiveNav from claims arising from breach of this Agreement by you, from your use of the Service from loss of Content due to your actions, or from alleged infringement by you.</p>
<p>If a dispute arises between you and DiveNav, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you and DiveNav agree to resolve any claim or controversy at law or in equity that arises from or relates to this Agreement or our Service (a "Claim") in accordance with one of the subsections below.</p>

Any violation by you of the terms of the foregoing sentence may result in immediate and permanent suspension or cancellation of your Account. You agree that DiveNav may take whatever steps it deems necessary to abridge, or prevent behavior of any sort on the Service in its sole discretion, without notice to you.</p>
<p>You are not permitted to use the marks " divePALTM ", ÒiDive ComputerÓ, "eDiving¨", "DiveComputerTraining¨", "DiveNav", or any other trade, service or other marks registered to or owned by DiveNav, except as explicitly authorized by DiveNav.</p>
