<h4>First Party</h4>
<p>Protecting your information</p>
<h4>Data Transfer</h4>
<p>Your data is secured by encryption, firewalls and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.  This is industry standard encryption technology which manages the security of messages transmitted across the internet.  When we receive your data, we store it on secure servers which can only be accessed by us.  We store your passwords using one way encryption which means we do not know what your password is.</p>
<h4>Data Transfer</h4>
<p>Storing your data within and outside the EEA</p>
<h4>Data Transfer</h4>
<p>Our third party data host provider uses servers located in the US to store personal data. As a result, when you use our Website or App, your personal data will be transferred to the US which is located outside of the European Economic Area and so is not governed by European data protection laws.</p>
<h4>First Party</h4>
<p>However, we have entered into the standard contractual clauses (Model Clauses) adopted by the European Commission with OrcsWeb Inc, in order to safeguard personal data when it is accessed from outside of the European Economic Area .</p>
<h4>Data Transfer</h4>
<p>We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this policy when it is transferred, stored or processed in this way.</p>
<h4>Data Transfer</h4>
<p>Whenever fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area, they impose the standard contractual clauses (Model Clauses) adopted by the European Commission on the recipients of that data in order to safeguard personal data when it is accessed from outside of the European Economic Area. They may also require the recipient to subscribe to ‘international frameworks’ intended to enable secure data sharing.</p>
<h4>First Party</h4>
<p>More information about the Model Clauses is available here http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087.</p>
<h4>First Party</h4>
<p>Social media</p>
<h4>First Party</h4>
<p>If you connect or integrate any social media services with services we provide, you may receive social notifications either from us or from third party companies providing social media services on our behalf. You can manage these social notifications through changing your privacy settings on the relevant social media site or discontinuing any interaction. If you register and provide information to a forum or blog on our Website or App, the information you provide will be published and will be publicly available on our Website or App. It may also be used to address any concerns or complaints about our services directly with you if you are an account holder.</p>
<h4>Policy Change</h4>
<p>Future changes</p>
<h4>Policy Change</h4>
<p>Any changes we make to our policy will be put on our Website and App and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail.  Please check for updates from time to time.</p>
<h4>Data Retention</h4>
<p>Retention of your Data</p>
<h4>Data Retention</h4>
<p>We will retain your personal data for as long as you continue to use our services.  Thereafter, we may retain your information for an additional period as is permitted or required under applicable laws. For example:</p>
<h4>First Party</h4>
<p>• If you hold an account with us, your personal data will be retained for five years after the closure of your account to comply with our obligations under anti-money laundering regulations;</p>
<h4>First Party</h4>
<p>• If you make a complaint, your personal data relating to that complaint will be retained for five years from the resolution of that complaint to defend against legal claims; and</p>
<h4>First Party</h4>
<p>• If you make any transactions on your account, your personal data relating to that transaction will be retained for seven years from the date of the transaction to comply with taxation and accountancy legislation.</p>
<h4>User Right</h4>
<p>Your rights</p>
<h4>User Right</h4>
<p>Data protection laws provide you with the following rights to:</p>
<h4>User Right</h4>
<p>• request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;</p>
<h4>User Right</h4>
<p>• request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected;</p>
<h4>User Right</h4>
<p>• request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below);</p>
<h4>User Right</h4>
<p>• request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it; and</p>
<h4>User Right</h4>
<p>• request a copy of your personal data which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and the right to transfer it, or to require us to transfer it directly, to another controller.</p>
<h4>User Right</h4>
<p>You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.</p>
<h4>User Right</h4>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights above). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.</p>
<h4>User Right</h4>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>
<h4>User Right</h4>
<p>Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, for example if we need your consent to send you any direct marketing, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please contact us using any of the details set out below in the “Contacting Us” section. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.</p>
<h4>User Right</h4>
<p>If you are unhappy about how your personal data has been used please refer to our complaints procedures, details of which can be found in your account Terms and Conditions. You also have a right to complain to the supervisory authority, which in the United Kingdom is the Information Commissioner's Office https://ico.org.uk/, which regulates the processing of personal data.</p>
