<p>Just created AIOS, the whole stack of Team has been thinking about how to respect and secure the privacy of users, as a "user-centric" service, will inevitably come into contact with a lot of your personal information. How to ensure your trust in us? To know that the user's trust is the fundamental to survive the AIOS; lost your trust, which means that AIOS will completely fail. The result of our concern is that we believe that the only way to win your trust is a high degree of self-discipline. As a mobile Internet products, AIOS must be cautious about the privacy of users, to avoid repeat the mistakes of the industry predecessors. So, as early as March 2014, even before we wanted to use the name "AIOS", we made reference to the international Internet business standards, developed the principle of user privacy, as our related work guidance. Over the past year, the whole stack of products from a single idea, gradually expanded into a "platform" of the system services, but we wrote a year ago, "AIOS" user privacy three principles, but has not changed:</p>
<h4>First Party</h4>
<p>First, collect only the information that really helps to enhance the user experience as little as possible.</p>
<h4>First Party</h4>
<p>Second, you may not collect any information that may identify the user's sole personal identity.</p>
<h4>First Party</h4>
<p>Third, the collection of personal information transparent, not to deceive users to deceive. Over the past year, "AIOS" has adhered to these three principles and has won more than 20,000 users and trust from a wide range of partners. Through more than 20,000 users sharing information and valuable advice with us, we have also made great improvements to our products. In the following, I will explain in detail how "AIOS" actually practices these principles. When you use, we receive the information in the use of "AIOS" process, and most of the mobile products, we will collect some use of information and sent to our server. The information received by our servers can be divided into two categories, one on how users use "AIOS" information, and the other is the user-owned data summary statistics. Let's take a closer look at what information "AIOS" will send. For example, the application service upgrade, what cell phone do you use? Is Android version 4.0 or 4.3? Are you using Apple 5 or the latest 6s? How big is your screen and memory? How is your phone hardware configuration? This information also includes a unique identification number for your computer and mobile phone. This information helps to help us arrange the order of the work, for example, through this information, we can make improvements to make you better experience.               AIOS itself information. For example, how often do you start AIOS? When will you stop using AIOS? We use this information to determine the effect of our various promotional methods to help us understand how to make more users know AIOS. It is through this information, we found that more than 85% of the AIOS users through the word of mouth to know our, here to the way and you say: Thank you! Information about application quality. For example, is there a crash in the process of using "AIOS"? If so, what is the cause of the crash? How does "AIOS" run on your phone? We use this information to improve the quality of the application to ensure that "AIOS" can be quickly and stably running on more users' handsets. For example, by constantly analyzing this information, we have reduced the collapse rate of products from nearly 10% to only a few thousandths in the past year. Information about the phone connection. For example, can you successfully use the "AIOS" connection on the phone, if not, what happens wrong? Is there any possibility of interference? Is there any problem with configuration? We use this information to analyze the user in the process of connecting the phone problems, and to improve the product. For example, by continually analyzing this information, we have added nearly 200 models of support over the past year and raised the success rate by more than 10 percentage points. The usage statistics of each function. For example, what are the most frequently and most frequently used features in AIOS? How many apps, music, videos, and ebooks have you viewed via AIOS? How many times have you clicked on a button? We use this data to determine your degree of preference for each feature of "AIOS", to assess whether our products meet your habits and make corresponding improvements.</p>
<h4>First Party</h4>
<p>Transparency and self-discipline As mentioned above, our third principle is "to transparentize the collection of personal information and not to deceive users." Although we have made it clear in the application user's agreement (www.webapps.cn.ren/sytk.html), we do not think it's exhaustive. Today published this information, but also hope to more thoroughly implement this principle. We also welcome anybody, whether users, media, or competitors, to supervise us. If we find any place where we violate the above principles, we will certainly correct. At present, our log send program for security reasons, do some encryption processing, we will as soon as possible to ensure the safety of the premise, to clear the text to send. Inevitably, such a description will always involve many technical concepts that you may be difficult to understand, and I have made it as simple and accurate as possible, but if you are still having any questions or suggestions for this, or after understanding, Practice any dissatisfaction, welcome to contact me directly.
